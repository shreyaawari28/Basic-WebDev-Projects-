# Practice on FlexBox (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of CSS Flexbox**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I learned **Flexbox**, which is one of the most important layout topics in CSS.  
I created a **navigation bar** using an unordered list and applied Flexbox properties to align the navigation items horizontally and space them evenly.

I also created two `<div>` elements and used Flexbox on the outer div to **center the inner div both horizontally and vertically**.

The project focuses on understanding layout alignment using Flexbox without using JavaScript.

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Navigation bar created using `<ul>` and `<li>`  
- Flexbox applied to the navigation bar using `display: flex`  
- Horizontal alignment of navigation items  
- Even spacing between navigation links using `justify-content`  
- Removal of default list styling  
- Outer div styled as a flex container  
- Inner div centered using:
  - `justify-content: center`  
  - `align-items: center`

## 🧪 How It Works
The navigation bar is treated as a flex container, which allows all menu items to align in a single row.  
Flexbox properties control the spacing and alignment of the navigation items.

The outer div is also converted into a flex container.  
Using Flexbox alignment properties, the inner div is placed exactly at the center of the outer div.

All layout behavior is handled using CSS only.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- No responsive design for different screen sizes  
- Static layout focused only on learning Flexbox  
- Minimal styling, focused on fundamentals  

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.
