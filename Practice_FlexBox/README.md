# Practice on FlexBox (HTML + CSS)

<details>
<summary><strong>📌 Overview</strong></summary>

This project is a **practice implementation of CSS Flexbox**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I learned Flexbox, which is one of the most important layout modules in CSS.  
I created a **navigation bar** and used Flexbox properties to align navigation items horizontally and space them evenly.  
I also created two `<div>` elements and used Flexbox to **center one div inside another** both horizontally and vertically.

The project focuses on understanding how Flexbox works for layout alignment and positioning, without using JavaScript.

- The outer div uses Flexbox to control alignment.
- The inner div is placed exactly at the center using Flexbox alignment properties.
- All layout behavior is handled purely using CSS.
