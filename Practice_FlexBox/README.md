# Practice on FlexBox (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of CSS Flexbox**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I learned **Flexbox**, which is one of the most important layout topics in CSS.  
I created a **navigation bar** using an unordered list and applied Flexbox properties to align the navigation items horizontally and space them evenly.

I also created two `<div>` elements and used Flexbox on the outer div to **center the inner div both horizontally and vertically**.

The project focuses on understanding layout alignment using Flexbox without using JavaScript.
