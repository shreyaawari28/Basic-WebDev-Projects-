# Practice on FlexBox (HTML + CSS)

<details>
<summary><strong>📌 Overview</strong></summary>

This project is a **practice implementation of CSS Flexbox**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I learned **Flexbox**, which is one of the most important topics in CSS.  
I created a **navigation bar** and used Flexbox properties to align the navigation items horizontally and space them evenly.

I also created two `<div>` elements and used Flexbox on the outer div to **align the inner div at the center**, both horizontally and vertically.

The project focuses on practicing layout alignment using Flexbox without using JavaScript.

<summary><strong>🧪 How It Works</strong></summary>

- The navigation bar is treated as a flex container, allowing menu items to align in a single row.
- Flexbox properties control spacing and alignment of navigation links.
- The outer div uses Flexbox for layout control.
- The inner div is centered both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox.
- All layout behavior is handled using CSS only.

<summary><strong>⚠️ Limitations</strong></summary>

- No JavaScript functionality  
- No responsiveness for different screen sizes  
- Static layout focused only on learning Flexbox  
- Minimal styling, focused on fundamentals  

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.
