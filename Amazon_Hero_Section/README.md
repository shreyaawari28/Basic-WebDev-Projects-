# Practice on Amazon Header with Hero Section (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of an Amazon-style webpage layout**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I extended the existing Amazon-style header by adding a **Hero Section** similar to the real Amazon homepage.  
The page now includes a **top navigation bar**, a **secondary menu panel**, and a **hero banner section** with a background image and informational message.

The project focuses on understanding **Flexbox layouts**, **background images**, **overlay messages**, and **real-world UI structuring** using only HTML and CSS.

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Amazon-style top navigation bar

- Delivery location section with location icon  
- Search bar with dropdown, input, and search icon  
- Account & Lists section  
- Returns & Orders section

- Secondary navigation panel with menu options  
- Hero section with full-width background image  
- Informational message box over hero image  
- Hover effects using reusable `.border` class  
- Layout built entirely using Flexbox

## 🧪 How It Works
The header is divided into two parts:  
- **Navbar**: Uses Flexbox to align logo, search bar, and account/cart sections horizontally.  
- **Panel**: A secondary navigation bar containing category links and deal options.

Below the header, the **hero section** uses a background image set via CSS.  
Flexbox is used to align a white message box at the bottom-center of the hero image, replicating Amazon’s homepage layout.

All layout behavior and styling are handled using CSS only.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- Search bar and links are non-functional  
- Not responsive for smaller screen sizes  
- Static layout focused on UI and layout practice  

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.
