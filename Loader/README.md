# Practice on CSS Loader (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of a CSS-based loader animation**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I learned how to create a **simple circular loading spinner** using CSS borders and animations.  
A single `<div>` is styled as a circle with a thick border, where one side of the border is highlighted to create a spinning loader effect.

The project focuses on understanding **CSS animations (`@keyframes`)** and **transform rotations** without using JavaScript.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice basic HTML structure  
- Learn how to create loaders using pure CSS  
- Understand `border` and `border-radius` usage  
- Learn CSS animations with `@keyframes`  
- Apply rotation using `transform: rotate()`  
- Create infinite animations using CSS

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Single `<div>` used as a loader  
- Circular shape created using `border-radius: 50%`  
- Thick border applied to create loader structure  
- One side of the border highlighted for spinning effect  
- Smooth rotation animation from `0deg` to `360deg`  
- Infinite animation using `animation-iteration-count: infinite`  
- Loader positioned on the screen using CSS

## 🧪 How It Works
The loader is a circular `<div>` created using equal height and width with `border-radius: 50%`.  
A thick border is applied on all sides, and one side of the border is given a darker color.

A CSS animation is defined using `@keyframes` that rotates the element from `0deg` to `360deg`.  
This animation is applied to the loader with an infinite duration, creating a continuous spinning effect.

All animation logic is handled using CSS only.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- Loader position is fixed using absolute positioning  
- Not responsive to different screen sizes  
- Basic styling focused only on animation concept  

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.
