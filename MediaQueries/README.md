# Practice on Media Queries (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of CSS Media Queries**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I learned **Media Queries**, which are used to apply different CSS styles based on screen size.  
I created a single `<div>` element and changed its background color depending on the **viewport width** using media queries.

The project focuses on understanding **responsive behavior** using CSS only, without JavaScript.
