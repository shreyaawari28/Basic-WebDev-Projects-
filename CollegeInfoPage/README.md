# College Website (HTML Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **static college website** built using **pure HTML** as part of my HTML learning practice.  
It focuses on understanding **HTML structure, semantic tags, tables, lists, and media embedding** without using CSS or JavaScript.

The website represents a basic informational portal for a college, including courses offered, timetable, and faculty details.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Strengthen fundamentals of **HTML**
- Practice **semantic HTML tags** (`header`, `main`, `table`, `ul`, etc.)
- Build structured web pages **without CSS or JavaScript**
- Understand correct usage of:
  - Tables
  - Lists
  - Images
  - Headings
- Create a **GitHub-hostable static website**

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- College header with logo and title

- Faculty details with images  
- Proper usage of:
  - `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No CSS styling used  
- No JavaScript interactivity  
- Layout handled using basic HTML attributes (`center`, `align`, `border`)  

These limitations are **intentional** and align with the goal of learning **HTML fundamentals only**.
