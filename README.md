# Basic WebDev Projects

## 👋 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **small HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects** built while learning the fundamentals of web development.

These are **practice-first projects** — not polished products — created to understand how the web works at a foundational level. The focus is on clarity, correctness, and hands-on learning rather than visual complexity.
