# Basic WebDev Projects

Hey there 👋  
This repo is basically a bunch of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** projects I built while learning the basics of web development.  
Nothing too fancy — just clean, simple projects that helped me understand how the web actually works.

---

## Why I Made This
I wanted a place to track my progress as I learn web development — starting from absolute basics.  
These projects helped me:
- Practice layout and styling  
- Learn how HTML, CSS, and JS actually connect  
- Build confidence before jumping into frameworks  

---

## Tools I Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- VS Code for editing  

---

## What’s Next
I plan to:
- Add more creative mini-projects  
- Improve the designs bit by bit  
- Try hosting each one using **GitHub Pages** so anyone can view them live

Thanks for checking this out!  
If you’re also learning web dev — trust me, even small projects like these teach you *a lot*.
