# Basic WebDev Projects

Hey there 👋  
This repo is basically a bunch of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** projects I built while learning the basics of web development.  
Nothing too fancy — just clean, simple projects that helped me understand how the web actually works.

## Why I Made This
I wanted a place to track my progress as I learn web development — starting from absolute basics.  
These projects helped me:
- Practice layout and styling  
- Learn how HTML, CSS, and JS actually connect  
- Build confidence before jumping into frameworks
