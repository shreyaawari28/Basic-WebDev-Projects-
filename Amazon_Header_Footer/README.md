# Practice on Header and Footer Layout (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of a basic webpage layout**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I focused on building a **fixed header (navigation bar)** and a **footer** similar to an Amazon-style layout.  
The header contains navigation links, a search input, and a button, while the footer stays visible at the bottom using CSS positioning.

The project emphasizes understanding **positioning (`fixed`, `sticky`)**, layout structure, and basic styling using CSS only.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice semantic HTML structure (`header`, `main`, `footer`)  
- Learn to create a navigation bar using CSS  
- Understand `position: fixed` and `position: sticky`  
- Style links, buttons, and input elements  
- Learn spacing and alignment using CSS  
- Build a basic page layout without JavaScript

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Fixed navigation bar at the top using `position: fixed`  
- Amazon-style logo text with custom color  
- Navigation links using anchor tags  
- Search input field with search button  
- Large scrollable main content area  
- Footer created using semantic `<footer>` tag  
- Footer styled and positioned using CSS  
- Consistent color theme for header and footer

## 🧪 How It Works
The header is created using a `<header>` tag containing a navigation bar div.  
CSS `position: fixed` is used so the navbar stays visible while scrolling.

The main section contains long content to demonstrate scrolling behavior.  
The footer is styled using a dark background and aligned text, remaining visible at the bottom using CSS positioning.

All layout behavior and styling are handled using HTML and CSS only.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- No responsive design for smaller screens  
- Large margins used for spacing (not optimized)  
- Static content focused on layout practice  

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.
