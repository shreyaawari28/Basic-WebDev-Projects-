# Practice on Amazon Header with Navigation Panel (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of an Amazon-style website header**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I built a **complete header section** consisting of a **top navigation bar** and a **secondary navigation panel** (menu bar), similar to Amazon’s real website layout.  
The header includes a logo, delivery location, search bar, account options, cart section, and a menu panel with multiple navigation links.

The project focuses on mastering **Flexbox**, **icons using Font Awesome**, **hover effects**, and **real-world UI structuring** using only HTML and CSS.

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Amazon-style top navigation bar  
- Logo section using background image  
- Delivery address section with location icon  
- Search bar with dropdown, input, and search icon

## 🧪 How It Works
The header is divided into two main parts:  
1. **Navbar** – built using Flexbox for horizontal alignment of logo, search bar, and user options.  
2. **Panel** – a secondary menu bar containing category links and deals.

Font Awesome icons are used for the menu, location, search, and cart icons.  
Reusable `.border` class is applied to multiple elements to provide consistent hover effects.

All styling and layout behavior are handled purely with CSS.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- Dropdowns and search are non-functional  
- Not responsive for smaller screen sizes  
- Static layout created for UI practice only  

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.
