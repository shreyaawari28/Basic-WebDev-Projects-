# Traffic Light Simulation (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple **traffic light layout** created using **HTML and CSS**.  
It visually represents a traffic signal with **red, yellow, and green lights** stacked vertically inside a black container.

The project is meant for **practicing basic HTML structure and CSS styling**, without using JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice HTML page structure
- Understand CSS styling using `id` selectors
- Learn centering elements using margins
- Create circular shapes using CSS
- Build a static visual component using HTML and CSS only

---


## 🚀 Demo
🔗 [Live Demo](https://shreyaawari28.github.io/Basic-WebDev-Projects-/Traffic_Light/) 



## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Page heading using `<h1>`
- Traffic signal body using a parent `<div>`
- Three circular lights:
  - Red
  - Yellow
  - Green
- Centered layout using `margin: auto`
- Proper usage of:
  - `height`, `width`
  - `background-color`
  - `border-radius`
  - `margin` and `padding`

---

## 🧪 How It Works
- The black rectangular container represents the traffic signal housing.
- Three circular div elements inside it represent the traffic lights.
- Each light is styled individually using CSS IDs.
- The entire signal is centered horizontally on the page.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality
- No animation or light switching logic
- Static visual representation only
- Minimal styling, focused on fundamentals

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the HTML file in any web browser
2. Ensure the CSS file is linked correctly
3. The traffic light will render immediately
